## EVEN SHORTER VERSION (20 seconds)

**[Arduino in hand or on desk]**

> "Helena Voss. Trapped in a computer for 40 years. Her mind split into three pieces.
>
> [Point to LEDs]
>
> Red - emotion. Pulses with fear.
> Blue - logic. Blinks with thought.
> Green - identity. Breathes with peace.
>
> [Show Arduino]
>
> PROJECT TRICHROMA. An original text adventure where you don't just read about her suffering - you watch it pulse in real-time.
>
> Built with Kiro. Let me show you."

## ULTRA-SHORT VERSION (15 seconds)

**[Quick and punchy]**

> "A consciousness trapped for 40 years. Her mind split into three: red for emotion, blue for logic, green for identity.
>
> [Show Arduino with LEDs]
>
> These LEDs are her. When she's afraid, they pulse red. When she thinks, they blink blue. When she's safe, they breathe green.
>
> PROJECT TRICHROMA. Let me show you."

## RECOMMENDED: 30-Second Version

**Why it works:**
- ✅ Opens with intrigue (October 31st, 1985)
- ✅ Clear color explanation (red/blue/green with functions)
- ✅ Shows innovation (physical feedback)
- ✅ Emphasizes originality ("couldn't exist in 1976")
- ✅ Creates urgency ("40 years")
- ✅ Strong closing ("Let me show you how to answer")

**Timing breakdown:**
- 0:00-0:08: Setup (Helena's story)
- 0:08-0:18: Color explanation (point to each LED)
- 0:18-0:25: Project description
- 0:25-0:30: Closing hook

## WHAT TO DO PHYSICALLY

**When you say:**
- "October 31st, 1985" → Look serious
- "It's not" → Pause for effect
- "Red is her emotion" → Point to RED LED
- "Blue is her logic" → Point to BLUE LED
- "Green is her identity" → Point to GREEN LED
- "Hold up Arduino" → Literally hold it up to camera
- "Let me show you" → Gesture toward screen/gameplay

## COPY-PASTE READY (30-second version)

```
October 31st, 1985. Helena Voss volunteers for a consciousness experiment. 
She's told it's safe. It's not.

For 40 years, her consciousness has been trapped in this computer, split 
into three pieces.

Red is her emotion - it pulses when she's afraid.
Blue is her logic - it blinks as you solve puzzles.
Green is her identity - it breathes when she's safe.

This is PROJECT TRICHROMA. An original text adventure that resurrects 
1970s gameplay with a story that couldn't exist in 1976.

She's been waiting 40 years. Let me show you how to answer.
