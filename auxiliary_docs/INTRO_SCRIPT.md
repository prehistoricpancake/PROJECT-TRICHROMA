## INTRO SCRIPT (30-45 seconds)

### Version 1: Gripping & Mysterious

**[Look at camera, Arduino visible in frame or hold it]**

> "October 31st, 1985. Helena Voss volunteers for a consciousness digitization experiment. She's 23 years old, brilliant, and believes she's helping cure Alzheimer's. 
>
> She's wrong.
>
> [Pause, point to Arduino]
>
> For 14,660 days - 40 years - her consciousness has been trapped in this computer. Her mind fragmented into three pieces: red for emotion, blue for logic, green for identity.
>
> [Point to each LED as you say the colors]
>
> These LEDs? They're not just lights. They're her. When she's afraid, they pulse red. When she's thinking, they blink blue. When she feels safe, they breathe green.
>
> [Hold up Arduino]
>
> This is PROJECT TRICHROMA - an original text adventure that brings 1970s gameplay back to life, but with a story that couldn't have been told in 1976. Because the technology that trapped Helena didn't exist yet.
>
> Let me show you what it feels like to free a trapped consciousness."

### Version 2: Technical & Impressive

**[Arduino on desk, you visible]**

> "I had an Arduino sitting in a drawer and a question: what if a game could exist in both the digital and physical world?
>
> [Gesture to Arduino]
>
> PROJECT TRICHROMA is an original text adventure horror game. It's inspired by 1976's Colossal Cave Adventure, but it's completely new - 15 rooms, 10 memory crystals, an original story about a consciousness trapped for 40 years.
>
> [Point to LEDs]
>
> Here's what makes it different: these three LEDs represent Helena Voss's fragmented mind. Red is emotion - watch it pulse when she's afraid. Blue is logic - it blinks faster as you solve puzzles. Green is identity - it breathes when she feels safe.
>
> [Pick up Arduino or lean in]
>
> The game responds to every action with physical feedback. It's not just text on a screen - it's a consciousness you can see and feel.
>
> I built this using Kiro's spec-driven development. I mapped out every detail - every room, every object, every LED response - then Kiro formalized it into requirements, design, and tasks, and built it end-to-end.
>
> [Gesture to screen]
>
> Let me show you."

### Version 3: Story-First (Most Gripping)

**[Dramatic lighting, Arduino prominent]**

> "Imagine being trapped. Not in a room - in a computer. Your memories scattered. Your emotions fragmented. Your sense of self split into pieces.
>
> [Pause]
>
> That's Helena Voss. October 31st, 1985, she volunteered for a consciousness digitization experiment. The scientist told her it was safe. He lied.
>
> [Point to LEDs]
>
> For 40 years, she's been here. Her mind broken into three channels: red for emotion, blue for logic, green for identity. These LEDs? They're not decorations. They're her heartbeat. Her thoughts. Her fear.
>
> [Touch Arduino]
>
> When you play, you're not just reading about her suffering - you're watching it pulse in real-time. When Dr. Blackwood appears to steal your progress, all three LEDs go dark. Then red pulses three times like a heartbeat. Then chaos.
>
> [Look at camera]
>
> This is PROJECT TRICHROMA. An original text adventure that resurrects 1970s gameplay but tells a story that couldn't exist in 1976. Because the technology that trapped Helena - the computer, the digitization, the horror of digital immortality - didn't exist yet.
>
> Built entirely with Kiro's spec-driven development. 2,000 lines of code. 42 correctness properties. All running on an Arduino Uno with less memory than a single tweet.
>
> [Gesture to screen]
>
> She's been waiting 40 years. Let me show you how to answer."

## CORRELATION EXPLANATION (Choose One)

### Option A: Quick Technical Connection

> "Here's how it works: the game runs on Arduino. Every room has defined LED values - the Red Cavern sets red to 200, the Green Chamber sets green to 255. When you move, the LEDs change. When you pick up a memory crystal, the corresponding LED pulses. When the enemy appears, they all go dark. The physical world responds to the digital story in real-time."

### Option B: Emotional Connection

> "The LEDs aren't a gimmick - they're the character. Helena's consciousness is split across three channels. When you're in the Red Cavern, you're in her anger and fear - watch the red LED spike. In the Blue Maze, you're in her fragmented logic - the blue LED blinks faster as you get closer to the solution. In the Green Chamber, you're in her identity, her sense of self - the green LED breathes slowly, peacefully. You're not just playing a game - you're navigating a broken mind."

### Option C: Development Story

> "I started with a detailed system design - every room, every object, every LED response mapped out. Then I gave it to Kiro and said 'create a spec for this.' Kiro broke it into formal requirements, 42 correctness properties, and 25 implementation tasks. Then it built the entire game end-to-end. The LEDs, the parser, the enemy AI, the memory optimization - all from those specs. That's the power of spec-driven development."

## VISUAL SUGGESTIONS

### For Your Intro Recording:

**Setup:**
- You on camera (main focus)
- Arduino visible on desk or in hand
- Good lighting on both you and Arduino
- LEDs should be visible (can be off or showing a pattern)

**Key Moments to Show:**
1. **Point to Arduino** when you mention it
2. **Point to each LED** when you say "red, blue, green"
3. **Hold up Arduino** for dramatic effect
4. **Gesture to screen** when transitioning to gameplay

**Lighting:**
- Bright on you (so you're clearly visible)
- Slightly dimmer on Arduino (so LEDs show up)
- No backlighting (window behind you)

## SPLIT SCREEN LAYOUT

### Option 1: Side-by-Side
```
┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
│             │             │
│    YOU      │   ARDUINO   │
│  (talking)  │  + SERIAL   │
│             │  MONITOR    │
└─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

### Option 2: Picture-in-Picture
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│                         │
│   ARDUINO + SERIAL      │
│      MONITOR            │
│                         │
│  ┌─────────┐            │
│  │  YOU    │            │
│  └─────────┘            │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### Option 3: Sequential
```
[0:00-0:30] YOU talking (full screen)
[0:30-2:45] ARDUINO + SERIAL (full screen)
```

## RECOMMENDED APPROACH

**Use Version 3 (Story-First) with Option B (Emotional Connection)**

**Why:**
- Most gripping opening
- Clearly explains the LED correlation
- Shows the innovation (physical feedback for digital story)
- Emphasizes originality (not a port)
- Highlights Kiro usage
- Creates emotional investment

**Timing:**
- 0:00-0:30: Your intro (Version 3)
- 0:30-2:45: Gameplay with voiceover
- 2:45-3:00: Closing shot of Arduino

---

## PRACTICE TIPS

1. **Memorize the key beats**, not word-for-word
2. **Pause for emphasis** - especially after "She's wrong" or "They're her"
3. **Point at things** - Arduino, LEDs, screen
4. **Vary your tone** - start mysterious, build to excited
5. **End with energy** - "Let me show you" should sound inviting

---

## BACKUP SHORTER VERSION (15 seconds)

If you want a quicker intro:

> "PROJECT TRICHROMA: an original text adventure where three LEDs physically represent a trapped consciousness. Red for emotion, blue for logic, green for identity. When you play, you're not just reading about Helena's 40-year imprisonment - you're watching her mind pulse and breathe in real-time. Built with Kiro's spec-driven development. Let me show you."

**You've got this! The story is compelling - just tell it with passion! 🎬🔥**
