## Alternative Paths

### Speedrun Route
If you want to complete the game quickly (not for perfect score):
1. Collect only crystals needed to access ADMIN_ROOM (all 10)
2. Don't deposit them (skip +50 points from deposits)
3. Rush to ADMIN_ROOM
4. Defeat Blackwood
5. Execute shutdown

**Speedrun Score:** ~100 points (EXPERIENCED HACKER rank)

### Exploration Route
Take your time to:
- Read all room descriptions carefully
- Examine every object
- Talk to Helena in different rooms
- Discover all easter eggs (XYZZY, PLUGH, ZORK, NEWS, .SNOOPER, 666, TRACE)
- Experience Helena's idle whispers (wait 30 seconds)
- Map the entire world on paper

---

## Troubleshooting

### "You can't go that way"
- Check the room's available exits with LOOK
- Refer to the map in PLAYER_GUIDE.md

### "I don't see that here"
- Use LOOK to see what objects are in the room
- Check INVENTORY to see what you're carrying

### "You're carrying too much"
- Maximum 8 items in inventory
- Drop items you don't need immediately
- Deposit crystals at trophy case

### Lost in the Maze
- Drop LAMP as a location marker
- Draw a map on paper as you explore
- The solution path is: MAZE_1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → CENTER

### Blackwood Keeps Stealing Crystals
- Deposit crystals at trophy case immediately after collecting
- Avoid RED rooms when carrying 3+ crystals
- Use GREEN_CHAMBER as safe zone (0% spawn rate)

### Can't Enter Admin Room
- Must have all 10 crystals deposited in trophy case
- Verify with: EXAMINE TROPHY_CASE

### Forgot Wire Cutter
- Must return to MAZE_CENTER to get it
- Cannot defeat Blackwood without it
