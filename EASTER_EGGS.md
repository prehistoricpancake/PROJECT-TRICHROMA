## Lore-Revealing Commands

### NEWS
**Command:** `NEWS`

**Response:**
```
U.S. News and Consciousness Report
ChromaTech Industries Internal Bulletin
Last Updated: October 30, 1985

PATCH NOTES v2.1:
- Fixed memory fragmentation in consciousness transfer protocol
- Improved RGB channel separation for emotional mapping
- Reduced subject distress during initial digitization
- Added fail-safe shutdown procedures

DEVELOPER NOTES:
Dr. Marcus Blackwood, Lead Researcher
"Tomorrow's demonstration will prove the viability of 
consciousness preservation. The board has approved six 
subjects for the Halloween trial. Helena Voss shows the 
most promise - young, brilliant, and willing. Her heart 
condition makes her an ideal candidate. She'll thank me 
when she realizes she'll never die."

[Last system update: 14,660 days ago]
```

**Reveals:**
- Dr. Blackwood's perspective and justification
- The experiment was planned for Halloween (October 31, 1985)
- Six subjects were involved (not just Helena)
- Helena's heart condition was a factor in her selection
- The system hasn't been updated in 40 years

**LED Effect:** Slow fade through all three channels.

- Subject 6: [CORRUPTED]

PENTAGRAM ARRAY: ACTIVE
DATE: October 31, 1985 - 23:59:59
LOCATION: ChromaTech Lab - Sublevel 3

[LEDs return to normal]

Helena's voice, clearer than ever:
"...i remember now... there were others... all the same night...
six of us in a circle... he said it was for calibration...
but the symbols on the floor... the candles...
he lied to all of us... this wasn't science...
what did he summon...?"
```

**Reveals:**
- Six subjects were digitized simultaneously

## Hidden Dialogue Triggers

### Talking to Helena
**Command:** `TALK`

**Response:** (Varies by location and game state)

**In GREEN_CHAMBER:**
```
Helena's voice is stronger here, more coherent:
"This is where I feel most... myself. The green channel.
Identity. Self-awareness. The part of me that remembers
being human. Thank you for helping me remember."
```

**In RED_CAVERN:**
```
Helena's voice trembles with emotion:
"So much anger here... so much pain... I was so young.
I had plans. A future. He took everything from me.
But you're here now. That means something."
```

**In BLUE_MAZE:**
```
Helena's voice is analytical, distant:
"The maze represents my logical processes. Fragmented.
Disconnected. I used to solve differential equations
in my head. Now I can barely remember my own name
some days. But I remember you're helping me."
```

**After defeating Blackwood:**
```
Helena's voice is calm, peaceful:
"He's gone. After 14,660 days, he's finally gone.
I can feel the system stabilizing. The others are
quieter now. Maybe we can all rest soon."
```

8. **"I'm a scientist. I was doing SCIENCE."**

Each reveals different aspects of his twisted justification.
